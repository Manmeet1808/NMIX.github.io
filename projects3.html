                <div class="description"> This is the final website that I and a few other teammates created called OiStir. The purpose of this site is to provide
                    a platform for users, specifically content creaters, screenwriters, and others within that type of field, to have a place to kickstart their 
                    creative process. OiStir focuses mainly on writers who want to write a script regarding the climate crisis. A link to the website can be found 
                    by clicking the image on the left.  
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Once in the site, the user will first see a collection of words moving across the screen vertically. The movement of the words was set this way so that 
                    our site could properly reflect what might be going on in someone's brain as they are brainstorming. As the words move, the user has the ability to click 
                    any of the words to bring up curated audio clips that reference the chosen word as the main topic. The user can then listen to the clips and jot down notes
                    to begin brainstorming. There is also a pause button on the top right if the user wants to stop the movement of the words at any point. The audio clips themselves
                    are stored in firebase and are linked to their specific word. In this way, OiStir aims to help users gain the pearl of inspiration they need to create change!

                <div class="description"> As part of our final checkpoint for the capstone, we were tasked with creating a trailer to introduce OiStir.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    My role within creating the trailer was to help with behind the scenes. I worked with our team to ensure that the script we had all created had 
                    appropriate scenes that could help the audience understand what our project was about. The main character within the show was our teammate, Saba. 
                    Helping with the backend of the trailer really taught me how important it is to have well thought out scenes that go with the script and have scenes 
                    that an audience without any knowledge of OiStir, could still understand.

                <div class="description">This is my project website that contains information and links of what we were able to accomplish for our capstone. The link to the website
                    can be found using the image to the left.  
                    <br><br>
                   We made sure that the project website follows the design patterns that we designed to our actual OiStir Site. The first thing you will find when you enter is the 
                   OiStir logo. As you scroll down, you will see some information about the features in the site, an introduction of the team, as well as links to all of the completed
                   assignments in each of the checkpoints for the capstone!

                <div class="description">This is an app I created called Disney-Fantasy Clash!. In this app users will be able to choose their favorite Disney
                princess and get fantasy book recommendations that correlate with that princess's story! Since I am a fanatic of both
                disney and fantasy genre books, I thought why not combine the two into an app!
                <br><br>
                By pressing the start here button, you will be sent to a view that allows you to pick between 8 princess. Once you click
                on a princess, it will take a view to that allows you to look at 3 different books that correlate to that princess's
                story! If you click on the book, you will see the author name as well as the synopsis of the book! If you have time,
                feel free to add your feedback to the app as well using the 'If you have a bit of time' button! Thank you so much for
                using the App, and I hope you enjoy!</div>
